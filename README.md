# Mend WebRTC Coding Challenge

## Description
This coding test is designed to evaluate your technical understanding and adaptability while working with a WebRTC based solution. This repo contains a very basic video chat sample project that is ready to be deployed. In order to use this repo, you will need to sign up for a trial account with Opentok to obtain credentials needed. You can sign up for this account for free here: https://tokbox.com/account/user/signup

This project uses the Opentok video platform, SDK documentation can be found here: https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/js/
 

## Instructions

1. Fork this repo to your local machine.
2. Make an initial commit to your repo to indicate the start time.
3. Sign Up for a free trial account with Opentok/Vonage: https://tokbox.com/account/user/signup
4. Below is a set of add on features that need to be added along with descriptions of how they should function. Implement as many of these features as you can within a reasonable time limit . There are a few features that are required, the other features are up to you to decide which ones you want to implement.
5. Once implemented, commit and push your changes.  Please know that we are looking for thought process, code quality and overall engineering leadership.  The count of features implemented is not as critical.
